            <h2>About SimWiki</h2>
            <p>SimWiki was created to address a critical challenge in healthcare education: the high cost of simulation equipment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Healthcare simulation is an essential component of modern medical education, allowing students and professionals to practice clinical skills in a safe, controlled environment. However, commercial simulation equipment often comes with prohibitive price tags:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                <li>High-fidelity manikins can cost £30,000-£80,000</li>
                <li>Task trainers typically range from £500-£5,000 each</li>
                <li>Complete simulation center setups can exceed £500,000</li>
                <li>Network and AV systems add tens of thousands to costs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These expenses put quality simulation training out of reach for many institutions, particularly smaller hospitals, GP surgeries, and educational facilities with limited budgets.</p>

                <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> While SimWiki provides cost-effective alternatives, it's crucial to ensure that any DIY or alternative equipment meets appropriate safety and training standards. Always:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li>Consult with your institution's health and safety officers</li>
                    <li>Ensure compliance with relevant training accreditation requirements</li>
                    <li>Test all equipment thoroughly before use with learners</li>
                    <li>Consider whether cost savings compromise training quality</li>
                    <li>Document and validate your alternatives appropriately</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
