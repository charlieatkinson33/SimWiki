# About SimWiki

## Our Mission

SimWiki exists to make healthcare simulation education more accessible and affordable by sharing creative, cost-effective alternatives to expensive commercial equipment.

## The Problem

Healthcare simulation is an essential component of modern medical education, but the costs can be prohibitive:

- Task trainers: £500-£5,000 each
- High-fidelity manikins: £50,000-£100,000
- Audio-visual systems: £10,000-£50,000 per room
- Consumables and supplies: Thousands per year

These costs create barriers for:
- Small training centers
- Resource-limited settings
- Universities with limited budgets
- Independent educators
- Developing simulation programs

## Our Solution

SimWiki brings together the collective wisdom of simulation educators who have found creative "McGyvering" solutions to reduce costs while maintaining educational effectiveness.

### What We Offer

**Cost Comparisons**: Clear breakdowns of commercial vs. DIY options

**Detailed Instructions**: Step-by-step guides for creating your own equipment

**Supplier Information**: UK-specific sources for materials

**Community Knowledge**: Real-world tested solutions from educators

**Continuous Updates**: Regular additions as new techniques emerge

## Our Approach

### Evidence-Based Creativity

We encourage:
- Testing and validation of alternatives
- Documentation of effectiveness
- Honest assessment of limitations
- Sharing both successes and failures

### Educational Focus

Our alternatives prioritize:
- Learning objectives achievement
- Psychological fidelity over physical fidelity
- Cost-effectiveness
- Sustainability and reusability

### Community Collaboration

SimWiki is built by simulation educators, for simulation educators. We believe in:
- Open sharing of knowledge
- Supporting each other's success
- Building on existing ideas
- Recognizing contributors

## UK Healthcare Simulation Context

### The UK Simulation Landscape

The UK has a strong tradition of healthcare simulation:

- **Medical schools**: All UK medical schools use simulation
- **NHS trusts**: Many have dedicated simulation centers
- **HEENE/HENSS networks**: Regional simulation networks
- **ASPIH**: Association for Simulated Practice in Healthcare
- **NHET**: National simulation training programs

### UK-Specific Challenges

- NHS budget constraints
- Regional variations in funding
- Limited capital budgets
- Increasing demand for training
- Equipment maintenance costs

### UK Opportunities

- Collaborative purchasing networks
- Medical device loan schemes
- University partnerships
- Innovation grants
- Clinical engineering support

## Quality and Safety

### Our Standards

- **Safety First**: All alternatives must be safe for learners and educators
- **Educational Validity**: Solutions must support learning objectives
- **Honest Assessment**: We acknowledge limitations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates based on feedback

### What We Don't Do

- Compromise safety for cost savings
- Recommend unethical practices
- Promote copyright infringement
- Guarantee exact equivalence to commercial products

## Supporting the Community

### How SimWiki Helps

**New Programs**: Start simulation on a budget
