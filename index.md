# Welcome to SimWiki

**The Community Resource for Affordable Healthcare Simulation**

Healthcare simulation is essential for training medical professionals, but the costs can be prohibitive. SimWiki is here to help simulation educators find creative, cost-effective alternatives to expensive commercial equipment.

## What is SimWiki?

SimWiki is a collaborative platform where simulation educators share "McGyvering" techniques - creative, DIY approaches to building simulation equipment and materials at a fraction of the commercial cost.

## Why SimWiki?

- **Cost Savings**: Find alternatives that can save thousands of pounds
- **Community-Driven**: Learn from experienced simulation educators
- **Practical Solutions**: Real-world tested alternatives and techniques
- **UK-Focused**: Tailored to UK healthcare simulation standards and suppliers
